# cosmoSys deployment

Reproducible Docker Compose deployment for the current cosmoSys alpha. It is
intended for controlled persistent evaluation and is not yet declared
production-ready.

The repository provides two variants from one common definition:

- Redmine + cosmoSys;
- Redmine + cosmoSys + cosmoSys Requirements.

## Configure

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Replace `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `REDMINE_SECRET_KEY_BASE`. Generate the latter,
for example, with `openssl rand -hex 64`. The repository currently uses SSH
forwarding during image construction because the plugin repositories are
private; load an authorized GitHub key into your SSH agent first.

Validate both effective configurations:

```sh
./scripts/check-config.sh
```

## Base variant

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yml build
docker compose -f compose.yml up -d
```

## Requirements variant

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.requirements.yml build
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.requirements.yml up -d
```

The web service binds to `127.0.0.1:3000` by default. Put a TLS reverse proxy
in front of it or deliberately change `COSMOSYS_BIND_ADDRESS` and
`COSMOSYS_HTTP_PORT`.

Database and Redmine files use named persistent volumes. Do not use `down -v`
on an installation whose data must survive.

The default Redmine and PostgreSQL images, plugin sources and rspreadsheet
source are pinned to immutable revisions. Updating one is a deliberate change
that must be validated for both deployment variants.

The first login follows Redmine's normal initial-administrator procedure. The
managed `csys_help` and `csys_admin_help` content packages are not part of this
initial artifact; `scripts/bootstrap-content.sh` is only their future hook.
